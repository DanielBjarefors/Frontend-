            // Check if the text "Burn After Reading" appears *anywhere* on the page. Do this by getting the Text property of the root element, which returns all of the *visible* text on the page in a single string.
            // It should not appear, because by default Burn After Reading is hidden inside a collapsed section.
            var root = browser.FindElementByCssSelector("html");
            Assert.IsFalse(root.Text.Contains("Ad Astra"));

            // Now click the section header to expand the section.
            var link = browser.FindElementByLinkText("Actor");
            link.Click();

            // The above operation will take some time to complete, because the page needs to load the movies that were previously hidden. Luckily, our ImplicitWait setting will make the browser automatically wait (for up to the specified amount of time) if an element is not available immediately.
            // "tt0887883" is the ID of the movie that we are looking for. We found this by examining the HTML of the page.
            var movieLink = browser.FindElementByCssSelector("#actor-tt0887883 a");

            // Finally, check that "Burn After Reading" is now visible on the page.
            Assert.AreEqual("Ad Astra", movieLink.Text);
        }

        // This test uses a different kind of waiting than the previous one: explicit rather than implicit. With explicit waits, the browser does not automatically wait whenever we try to find an element. Instead, we need to explicitly state when to wait, and what condition to wait for. It also uses a more "fuzzy" assertion because it just looks for the movie title anywhere on the page, which might be more difficult to do with implicit wait because it does not actually call one of the Find methods to do it. (Only Find methods automatically wait when using implicit waits.)

            // Optionally make an assertion. (Optional because Wait will throw an exception if the specified condition does not become true in time, in turn also automatically failing the test.)
